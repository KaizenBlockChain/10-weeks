> I'm taking up a challenge to learn a new technology every week from Oct-2017. My goal is to get the core idea behind most of the buzz words in technology(within next 10 weeks), to build a simple application using it, and a blog about it. I'm more interested in answers to my wh questions..what-why-when-how-who/where..
