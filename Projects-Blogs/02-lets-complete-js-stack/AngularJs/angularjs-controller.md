* Controller is the business logic behind views
* The purpose of controllers is to expose variables and functionality to expressions and directives.
* The primary responsibility of a controller is to initialize scope objects.
* In practice, the initialization logic consists of the following responsibilities: providing initial values and augmenting `$scope` with UI-specific behavior (functions).
* Controllers in AngularJS are regular JavaScript functions.
