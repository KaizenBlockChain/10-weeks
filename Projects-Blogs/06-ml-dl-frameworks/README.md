### tf papers

* [TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems](http://download.tensorflow.org/paper/whitepaper2015.pdf) - This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google
* [TF.Learn: TensorFlow's High-level Module for Distributed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04251)
* [Comparative Study of Deep Learning Software Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06435) - The study is performed on several types of deep learning architectures and we evaluate the performance of the above frameworks when employed on a single machine for both (multi-threaded) CPU and GPU (Nvidia Titan X) settings
* [Distributed TensorFlow with MPI](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02339) - In this paper, we extend recently proposed Google TensorFlow for execution on large scale clusters using Message Passing Interface (MPI)
* [Globally Normalized Transition-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06042) - This paper describes the models behind [SyntaxNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet).
* [TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08695) - This paper describes the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems and demonstrate the compelling performance
