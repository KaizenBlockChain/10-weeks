### Context
**CPUs**:

* Status:  `End of Life` if Product End of Life notification has been published, `Active` if this specific part is active, `Pre Active` if orders may be taken, but not scheduled, nor shipped.
* Execute Disable Bit: hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks
* Thermal Monitoring Technologies: protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. 
* Idle States: are used to save power when the processor is idle.  
* Intel® My WiFi Technology: enables wireless connection of an UltrabookTM or laptop to WiFi-enabled devices such as printers, stereos, etc.
* Intel® 64 architecture: delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.
* Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables: reduces the memory and power overhead costs and increases battery life through hardware optimization of page table management.
* Intel® Virtualization Technology: allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.
* Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology: delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.
* Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically: increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.
* T (Junction Temperature): is the maximum  temperature allowed.
* Socket`: the component that provides the mechanical and electrical connections between the processor and motherboard.  
* PCI Express (PCIe) Configurations: the available PCIe lane configurations that can be used to link the PCH PCIe lanes to PCIe devices.
* PCI Express Revision: the version supported by the processor. 
* OpenGL: indicates support for a cross-language, multi-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
* DirectX: indicates support for a specific version of Microsoft’s collection of API’s for handling multimedia compute tasks
* Max Resolution :  the maximum resolution supported by the processor for a device with an integrated flat panel (24bits per pixel & 60Hz). System or device display resolution is dependent on multiple system design factors
* Max Resolution (DP):  the maximum resolution supported by the processor via the DP interface (24bits per pixel & 60Hz). System or device display resolution is dependent on multiple system design factors
* Max Resolution (HDMI): the maximum resolution supported by the processor via the HDMI interface (24bits per pixel & 60Hz). System or device display resolution is dependent on multiple system design factors; actual resolution may be lower on your system.
* 4K support indicates the product's support of 4K resolution, defined here as minimum 3840 x 2160.
* Graphics Output defines the interfaces available to communicate with display devices.
* The maximum amount of memory accessible to processor graphics. Processor graphics operates on the same physical memory as the CPU (subject to OS, driver, and other system limitations).
* Graphics max dynamic frequency : to the maximum opportunistic graphics render clock frequency (in MHz) that can be supported using Intel® HD Graphics with Dynamic Frequency feature.
* Graphics Base frequency : the rated/guaranteed graphics render clock frequency in MHz.
* Processor Graphics indicates graphics processing circuitry integrated into the processor
* ECC Memory Supported: ECC memory is a type of system memory that can detect and correct common kinds of internal data corruption.
* Max Memory bandwidth is the maximum rate at which data can be read from or stored into a semiconductor memory by the processor (in GB/s).
* The number of memory channels refers to the bandwidth operation for real world application.
* Channel Type: Single Channel, Dual Channel, Triple Channel, and Flex Mode.
* Max memory size: the maximum memory capacity supported by the processor.
* “Conflict free”: defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules to mean products that do not contain conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold) that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries.
* Thermal Design Power (TDP) represents the average power, in watts, the processor dissipates when operating at Base Frequency with all cores active under an Intel-defined, high-complexity workload. 
* CPU Cache is an area of fast memory located on the processor. 
* Max turbo frequency is the maximum single core frequency at which the processor is capable of operating using Intel® Turbo Boost Technology. Frequency is measured GHz
* Processor Base Frequency: describes the rate at which the processor's transistors open and close.
* A Thread, or thread of execution, is a software term for the basic ordered sequence of instructions that can be passed through or processed by a single CPU core. 
* Cores:  a hardware term that describes the number of independent central processing units 
* Embedded: In essence, an embedded processor is a CPU chip used in a system which is not a general-purpose workstation, laptop or desktop computer. [More information][1]
* Lithography : the semiconductor technology used to manufacture an integrated circuit, and is reported in nanometer (nm),

### Inspiration

* How did performance over price ratio evolve over time? 
* How about general computing power?  
* Are there any manufacturers that are known for some specific range of performance & price?
